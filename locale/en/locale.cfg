[entity-description]
po-electric-fuse=Much more likely to explode when overloaded and has a lower maximum consumption than the corresponding electric pole.
po-transformer=Separates electric networks from each other.\nEfficiency can be changed in mod settings.
po-interface=Can handle near-infinite amounts of power but only to one machine.\nCan be rotated once placed.

[item-name]
po-hidden-electric-pole=Transformer connection

[item-description]
po-hidden-electric-pole=Dummy item for representing transformer connections in blueprints. Will be removed when the transformer is placed.\nConnections may look incorrect if the blueprint is rotated or flipped, but this will resolve itself when the transformer is placed.

[mod-setting-description]
power-overload-disconnect-different-poles=Prevents accidentally connecting different networks that have different maximum consumptions.
power-overload-transformer-efficiency=How much energy is output for each unit input. 1 means all energy is transferred, 0 means no energy is transferred.

[string-mod-setting-description]
power-overload-on-pole-overload-nothing=Use temporarily when adding the mod to an existing save so that the necessary adjustments can be made first.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
po-main=An overview of the main features and changes from the mod [font=default-semibold]Power Overload[/font]. Demonstration simulations coming soon.\nA pole may explode if its network's total consumption exceeds that pole's maximum consumption. A pole's maximum consumption can be viewed in its tooltip.
po-transformer=[entity=po-transformer] can be used to separate networks so that each subnetwork can stay below its limit.\nTransformer power transfer is only 98% efficient (this can be changed in mod settings).
po-fuse=Fuses have a lower maximum consumption than their corresponding electric poles and are more likely to explode when overloaded.\nThey can be placed at the entrance to a subnetwork so that they will explode before the network's total consumption gets too high, cutting off the network from power, and so saving all other poles in the network from overload. Fuse usage is completely optional.
po-pole-connections=Since each pole type has a different maximum consumption, you will usually want each subnetwork to contain only a single type of pole.\nTo help with this, newly built poles will no longer automatically connect to poles of different types.
